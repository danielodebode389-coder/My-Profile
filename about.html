        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a frontend web developer who loves building clean and responsive websites. I enjoy working with JavaScript, React, Node.js and I am constantly improving my skills.
I’m a passionate coder who thrives on turning complex problems into elegant solutions. With a strong foundation in [languages/frameworks you use], I specialize in building efficient, scalable, and user‑friendly applications. My journey in tech is driven by curiosity and a love for continuous learning — whether it’s mastering new tools, contributing to open‑source projects, or experimenting with creative ideas.

Beyond writing clean and maintainable code, I value collaboration and clear communication. I believe great software isn’t just about functionality, but also about creating experiences that empower people.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new technologies, refining my craft, and sharing knowledge with the developer community. My goal is simple: to keep growing as a developer while building impactful projects that make a difference.</p>
